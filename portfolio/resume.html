            <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
            <p>From an early age, I've been deeply passionate about the arts, beginning my journey at 16 as an assistant to a wedding photographer. This experience ignited my love for visual storytelling, which I carried forward as a yearbook editor in high school. In college, I immersed myself even more into digital arts, where I could combine creativity with technology to bring ideas to life. For me, art is not just about creating—it’s about making a meaningful impact, connecting with others, and continually growth. </p>

            <h3>MY DESIGNS</h3>
            <p>Expressing passion in graphic design is about more than creating visually pleasing layouts; it’s about telling stories, evoking emotions, and communicating ideas with clarity and impact. A passionate designer constantly explores color, typography, and form, and brings imagination to each project. They are driven by the challenge of transforming abstract concepts into powerful visuals, experimenting with styles, and refining every detail until it resonates with the audience. What ignites a designer’s passion is the endless possibility to inspire, connect, and make a meaningful difference through every pixel and line they create.</p>
